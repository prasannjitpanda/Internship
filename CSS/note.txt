    # Flex-box:-
-This property is used to structure the elements in row wise or column wise by giving space allocation for individual elements within the flex area.
Properties:-

1. flex-direction:- It specifies from which direction the elements should be aligned.
Values:-
flex-direction: row/row-reverse/column/column-reverse ;

2. justify-content:- This is used to align the elements horizontally in the flex area.
Values:-
justify-content: start/center/end/space-between/space-around/space-evenly

3. align-items:- This property is used to align the items vertically in flex area.

align-items: flex-start/center/flex-end ;

# Grid-Layout:-
-CSS grid layout is a two dimentional layout system for the web.
-A grid is a collection of horizontal & vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up our design element. They help us to create designs where element don't jumps around or change width as we move from page to page.
Properties:-
display: grid;
grid-template-column: repeat(4,1fr)/ 3 4 5;
grid-gap : 20px/ 30px...
grid-template-rows: 100px/ 200px;

# CSS units :-
1. px (pixel) - fixed    1px=1/96 inch
2. % (percentage) - percentage is fully depends upon their parent element
3. vh (viewport height) & vw (viewport width) - it will increases or decrease their size as per the screen size.
4. vmax - if the screen size can be squized to a phone screen so our content can be small it break that and create a new line of content.
5. em & rem (root units of CSS) em - we can handle all tag by a root element/tag so that it would be fesiable for our content. (relative units, relative to any one) rem - (1rem = 16px)

-Transform properties are used to transform an element from one form to another form or to move from one position to another position.
1. Rotate:- It is used to rotate an object in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction.
-To rotate an element we use degree(deg) as an unit.
Properties:- 
    rotateX(deg) -It rotates an element on x-axis.
    rotateY(deg) -It rotates an element on y-axis.
    rotateZ(deg) -It rotates an element on z-axis.

2. Skew:- It distorts point of an element by a certain angle in horizontal or vertical direction.
Properties:- 
    horizontal:- skewX()
    vertical:- skewY()

3. Scale:- It allows us to resize an element compared to its original size.
-scale>1 will increase the size and scale<1 will decrease the size of an element.
